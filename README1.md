Challenge 1 - Code Refractor
The assignment for Week 1 of the Coding Bootcamp was to refractor existing code for a faux marketing agency.
Instructions:

To grade the css file, open [style.css] (Rebecca-E-Echols/Challenge1/style.css) in the Candice Ree repository account.

Thank you and best wishes!
